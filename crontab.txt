# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command

# NOTES

# Production crontab is now executed by root to enable writing on:
# - the backup server with backup.sh
# - the dao_saisie (W:) server with export_cadastre_to_dxf.sh
# Indeed it is not safe to execute a crontab script with sudo commands and password from a regular user account

# ADDITIONNAL NOTES
# - Keep in mind that this crontab installation does not log stdout (1)
#   therefore one must use 1>&2 to redirect all outputs (standard and normal)
#   to stderr (2).
# - Use > $FOLDERPATH/data_maintenance.sh>log.txt to log outputs to a file
# - For testing, use * * * * mon,tue,wed,thu,fri $FOLDERPATH/a_test_script.sh>&2
# - Keep in mind that while testing, if the cron job is run every minute,
#   it might not send an email at such frequency  if the task takes more time
#   than a minute.
